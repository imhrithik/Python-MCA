2. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 1000, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

3. Write a program which makes use of function to display all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 1000 and 2000.

4. Write a function cumulative_product to compute cumulative product of a list of numbers.

5. Write a function reverse to reverse a list. Without using the reverse function.

6. Define a function which generates Fibonacci series up to n numbers using RECURSION.

7. With a given tuple (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.

8. Write a program to count the numbers of characters in the string and store them in a dictionary data structure.
